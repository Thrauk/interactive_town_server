The destination object that we want our agent to interact with, given as a full link in the WorldTree
from the root of the WorldTree to the target itself,
separated by : and always starts with the root (the first element in the WorldTree representation).
You must only use locations from the worldTree without altering or adding anything.
EXAMPLE OUTPUT WorldRoot:Location1:Location2:Destination. You must not skip over any Node in the tree,
define the path by using every single node in the path.
